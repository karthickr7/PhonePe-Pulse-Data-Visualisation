# PhonePe-Pulse-Data-Visualisation and Exploration
# Problem Statement:
  The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to
various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
# Approach:
  1. Data extraction: Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the
Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV
or JSON.
  2. Data transformation: Use a scripting language such as Python, along with
libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may
include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data
into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.
  3. Database insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to
connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL
commands.
  4. Dashboard creation: Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create
an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map
functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used
to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to
select different facts and figures to display.
  5. Data retrieval: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the
MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in
the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.
  6. Deployment: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test
the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it
accessible to users.
# Learning outcomes of this project:
  1. Data extraction and processing: Learning how to use Clone Github to
extract data from a repository and pre-process the data using Python libraries
such as Pandas.
  2. Database management: Learning how to use a relational database such
as MySQL to store data and retrieve it efficiently for analysis and visualization.
  3. Visualization and dashboard creation: To use libraries
such as Streamlit and Plotly to create interactive and visually appealing
dashboards for data visualization.
  4. Geo visualization: Create and display data on a map
using Plotly's built-in geo map functions.
  5. Dynamic updating: Create a dashboard that
dynamically updates based on the latest data in a database.
  6. Project development and deployment: Develop a comprehensive and user-friendly solution, from data extraction to dashboard
deployment. Also learn how to test and deploy the solution to ensure it
is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
