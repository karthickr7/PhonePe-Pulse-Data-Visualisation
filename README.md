# PhonePe-Pulse-Data-Visualisation and Exploration
# Problem Statement:
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to
various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
# Approach:
  1. Data extraction: Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the
Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV
or JSON.
  2. Data transformation: Use a scripting language such as Python, along with
libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may
include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data
into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.
  3. Database insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to
connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL
commands.
